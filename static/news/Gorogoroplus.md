Hi everyone, and congratulations for making it through yet another challenging year! We apologize for the lack of posts recently, but rest assured, the team is constantly working in the background to continually improve the site.

We have an update for one of our variants: Gorogoro Shogi (special thanks to Ada!). You can now play the Gorogoro PLUS version, which is a version where players start with a knight and lance in hand. Hopefully this should add more variety to the Gorogoro games by having a greater range of pieces! The original Gorogoro is available to play as an alternate FEN, selectable through the game creation screen as usual.

Going forward, we will have some new variants planned, which we will be releasing over the next few months. Stay tuned for those!

Regarding activity, we are aware of some complaints that there are not enough players. Please keep in mind that this is a community-driven site. Makruk is already successful due to strong recruiting. Likewise, we will need active recruiting to bring players who are interested in playing different kinds of variants as well; this site is what you make it out to be. ðŸ™‚

Anyways, we wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
